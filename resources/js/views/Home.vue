                                    Regardless of the format of dental school
                                    interview (e.g. CDA structured interview,
                                    MMI, or Panel interview), the purpose of the
                                    interview is rather straightforward and
                                    remains constant across the board: to assess
                                    the personality and Non-Cognitive Skills
                                    (NCSs) of the candidate. What are NCSs? By
                                    these we mean the following: Communication
                                    skills, interpersonal skills, ethical and
                                    moral decision making capacity, maturity,
                                    professionalism, sense of social
                                    responsibility, service to community,
                                    leadership, initiative, scholarship, ability
                                    to collaborate with others, conflict
                                    resolution skills, etc. Research has shown
                                    that, although academic performance (i.e.
                                    GPA and DAT scores) is a great indicator of
                                    didactic abilities in the first and second
                                    years of dental school, it provides,
                                    however, a very poor predictive value when
                                    it comes to future clinical performance. In
                                    fact, research shows that, an effective
                                    interview process is the best indicator of
                                    future clinical performance in the upper
                                    years, as it gives insight into the
                                    characteristics of the candidate and whether
                                    or not there will be a likelihood of future
                                    behavioural problems (an issue that dental
                                    schools constantly encounter and struggle to
                                    overcome). For example, it has been shown
                                    that those candidates who are
                                    "conscientious" and "open to new
                                    experiences" perform more effectively in the
                                    third and fourth years of dental school
                                    studies, where the education takes place in
                                    a clinical setting for the most part. Thus,
                                    dental schools, much like other professional
                                    schools, have over the past decade spent a
                                    lot of resources to devise the most
                                    effective interview process that will give
                                    them insight into the NCSs of their future
                                    candidates. And of course, for Canadian
                                    dental schools the answer has been the
                                    Canadian Dental Association's structured
                                    interview or CDA structured interviews.

                                    The types of questions that you may be asked
                                    during your dental school interview can be
                                    divided into two categories: (1) Situational
                                    Interview (SI) questions and (2) Patterned
                                    Behaviour Descriptive Interview (PBDI)
                                    questions. SI questions are those in which
                                    the candidates is placed in a hypothetical
                                    situations (i.e. vignette) and is asked what
                                    they would react in that given situation.
                                    For example, "You are babysitting your
                                    sisterâ€™s young child, who is nervous and
                                    upset about his mother being away. You are
                                    trying to calm him down and offer him some
                                    ice cream. As you are dishing out the ice
                                    cream, the child bites down hard on your
                                    hand. How would you react?" Conversely, PBDI
                                    type questions, ask the candidates "about
                                    past behaviour with the assumption that past
                                    behaviour is the best predictor of future
                                    behaviour." An example of a PBDI type
                                    questions is: Many of us have had to deal
                                    with juggling busy schedules. Think of a
                                    time in the past when an important but
                                    unscheduled situation arose that required
                                    your attention, but you had a number of
                                    prior commitments on your agenda. What did
                                    you do? What was the outcome? Notice how SI
                                    questions are typically future-oriented, as
                                    opposed to PBDI questions, which are
                                    past-oriented. The specific and actual SI
                                    and PBDI questions are devised according to
                                    seven competencies, that the CDA has found
                                    to be reliable and valid indicators of
                                    future performance. In other words, every
                                    question that is asked during a dental
                                    school interview, regardless of being a SI
                                    or PBDI question, will address one or more
                                    than one of the seven competencies.

                                    The CDA structured interview is comprised of
                                    seven questions, one for each of the seven
                                    competencies described above. Each question,
                                    which can either be a SI or a PBDI type, is
                                    scored on a 5-point scale for a total and a
                                    maximum of 35 points by two interviewers who
                                    are either a pair of dentists, or senior
                                    dental students. The interview usually takes
                                    about 20-30 minutes to be completed. Click
